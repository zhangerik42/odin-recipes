    <h2> What is Banana Bread you may ask? </h2>
    <p>
        Banana bread is a type of bread made from mashed bananas. It is often a moist, sweet, cake-like quick bread;
        however
        there are some banana bread recipes that are traditional-style raised breads.
    </p>
    <h2> Recipe Description </h2>
    <p>
        Moist and delicious banana bread recipe. Easy to make, no need for a mixer! Ripe bananas, butter, sugar, egg,
        vanilla, baking soda, and flour.
    </p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 to 3 medium (7" to 7-7/8" long) very ripe bananas, peeled (about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups mashed) </li>
        <li> 1/3 cup (76g) butter, unsalted or salted, melted </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda (not baking powder) </li>
        <li> 1 pinch salt</li>
        <li> 3/4 cup (150g) sugar (1/2 cup if you would like it less sweet, 1 cup if more sweet) </li>
        <li> 1 large egg, beaten </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
        <li> 1 1/2 cups (205g) all-purpose flour </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C), and butter a 4 x 8-inch loaf pan. </li>
        <li> In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. Stir the melted butter into
            the mashed bananas. </li>
        <li> Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.</li>
        <li> Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour at 350째F (175째C), or until a
            toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay; streaks of
            wet batter are not. If the outside of the loaf is browned but the center is still wet, loosely tent the loaf
            with foil and continue baking until the loaf is fully baked..</li>
        <li> Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from the pan and
            let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't
            crumbly.)

            Wrapped well, the banana bread will keep at room temperature for 4 days. For longer storage, refrigerate the
            loaf up to 5 days, or freeze it. </li>
